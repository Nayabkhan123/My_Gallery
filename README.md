# My_Gallery
My Gallery is a clean, responsive image gallery web project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays aesthetic images in a stylish grid with grayscale hover effects. Clicking an image opens a lightbox with a zoomed view and dimmed background, offering a sleek and immersive user experience.
